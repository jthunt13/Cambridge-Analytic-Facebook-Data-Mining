To the Editor:
I’m shocked by “President Trump’s Thing for Thugs” (editorial, Nov. 14). Not by your central thesis, with which I agree. But by the casualness with which you seem to have seen fit to group together and label — dismissively and contemptuously — as “thugs” a rather diverse group of foreign leaders with quite different track records. Do you really believe that Xi Jinping should lead off your list of villains?
We Americans have every right to prefer a different way of organizing our society to the Chinese domestic system, whatever our current travails. And when China conducts itself externally in a manner that we consider unhelpful or even hostile to our own national interests, we have the right to assert ours. But your labeling Xi Jinping a “thug” struck me as outrageous.
Consider the damage you may be doing by extending this epithet so seemingly offhandedly to the leader of the nation making, arguably, faster progress for its people than any in human history.
